### 🌏 Problem
- One-quarter of the global greenhouse gases are related to food production and consumption, 80% of which are related to livestock.</br>
-If you switch to a vegetarian diet by 2050, greenhouse gases can be reduced by 63 percent and cost $973 billion.

 ### 🌏 Climate behavior Solution
 🔑 **the 13th item of Sustainable Development Goals** → The goal of 1W1M is to encourage beginners to start with an easy mission to consciously eat a vegetarian meal once a week and gradually increase their frequency.
